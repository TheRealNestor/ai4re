# Software Requirements Dataset

## About the Dataset

Software requirements define the functions, behaviors, and features of a software system. They serve as a blueprint outlining what the software must do to meet the needs of users, customers, or other stakeholders. Software requirements are generally categorized as Functional and Non-Functional, with further subdivisions.

This dataset contains 977 rows (excluding headers) and two columns:

- **Type**: The type of software requirement.
- **Requirement**: The description of the requirement.

## Labeling

The `Type` column uses the following labels:

- **F**: Functional
- **FR**: Functional Requirement
- **A**: Availability
- **FT**: Fault Tolerance
- **L**: Legal
- **LF**: Look & Feel
- **MN**: Maintainability
- **O**: Operational
- **PE**: Performance
- **PO**: Portability
- **SC**: Scalability
- **SE**: Security
- **US**: Usability
- **NFR**: Non-Functional Requirement

## Usage

This dataset can be used for research and development in requirements engineering, natural language processing, and machine learning tasks related to software requirements classification and analysis.
