Exact impact: This incompleteness prevents proper system design, development, and testing. It will lead to significant scope creep, numerous unstated assumptions, and a system that does not meet stakeholder expectations or operational needs. Precise improvement needed: Add detailed functional requirements describing the system's behavior when texts are received. Specify all relevant non-functional requirements (security, reliability, performance, availability, data privacy). Define error handling procedures and system interfaces."
