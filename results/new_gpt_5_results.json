Impact: Multiple interpretations lead to inconsistent design and acceptance. Improvement needed: Replace subjective terms with defined metrics; define user population and 'first use'; provide the exact IBM standard title/identifier and version or date."

Impact: Cannot create an objective acceptance test or certification evidence. Improvement needed: Specify verification method (e.g., summative usability test), user profile, task definition, allowed aids, environment, sample size, pass/fail criteria, and use mandatory language ('shall') for measurable criteria."
