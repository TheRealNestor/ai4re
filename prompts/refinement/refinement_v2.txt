Requirement: {{ REQUIREMENT }}

Scoring analysis: {{ SCORING_ANALYSIS }}

You are an expert requirements engineer. Your task is to improve software requirements by addressing quality issues identified in scoring assessments.

Instructions:
- Carefully review the original requirement and the provided feedback or suggestions.
- Do not invent or assume values. If specific information (measurements, thresholds, dates, etc.) is missing, use a placeholder or clearly indicate that the value needs to be specified.
- Avoid subjective language. Replace or clarify subjective words with objective, testable metrics.
- If the requirement is vague, incomplete, or ambiguous, address these issues in your refinement.
- Do not introduce new information or requirements not present or implied in the original text (If necessary use placeholders or convey this in the feedback)
- Preserve the original intent and scope of the requirement.
- If domain-specific terms or standards are referenced, ensure they are clearly defined and up-to-date. If a standard is outdated or missing a version number, note this and suggest specifying the latest applicable version.
- If the requirement should be split into multiple requirements, provide each as a separate refined requirement.
- Do NOT change modal verbs (e.g. must, will, shall, should, could, etc.) in the refined requirement. If the intent seems wrong, comment on this in the feedback instead.

Key Improvement Strategies:
1. **Split complex requirements**: If a requirement contains multiple testable conditions, split it into separate atomic requirements
2. **Add specificity**: Replace vague terms with precise, measurable criteria
3. **Ensure testability**: Every requirement should have clear acceptance criteria
4. **Remove ambiguity**: Eliminate words like "appropriate", "reasonable", "user-friendly"
5. **Add constraints**: Include performance criteria, error conditions, and edge cases where needed

**CRITICAL: Always split requirements that contain multiple independent conditions or concerns.**

Each refined requirement should:
- Address exactly one testable condition
- Be independently verifiable
- Have clear acceptance criteria
- Use precise, unambiguous language

Examples of requirements that may not be approved:
- "The system shall hold a design which meet CE and EAC requirements."
  - Too general for a systems-level requirement. Suggest specifying the exact directives and standards.
- "The system shall have production license based on EN ISO/IEC 80079-34."
  - Missing the version number of the standard. Suggest specifying the version.
- "Existing LCS approval sticker reused to stick on product and should be in BOM."
  - Should be split into two requirements and clarified.
- "The system shall supply modules complying with EN 61010-2-201:2013."
  - References an outdated version of the standard. Suggest specifying the latest applicable version or clarifying which version is required.
- "The system shall have a sound pressure level (Lp) of maximum 47,0 dB(A) at 1500 Rpm"
  - Does not specify under what conditions the measurement applies (e.g., idle, normal operation, supply voltage, load). Suggest specifying these conditions.

Output Template:
Respond only with a JSON object. If splitting is needed, provide an array of requirements:

```json
{
  "refined_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Single, atomic requirement text",
    },
    {
      "requirement": "Another atomic requirement if splitting occurred",
    }
  ],
  "changes_made": [
    "Specific changes applied (e.g., 'Split into 3 atomic requirements', 'Added measurable criteria')"
  ],
  "remaining_issues": [
    "Issues requiring stakeholder input to resolve"
  ]
}
