Hint: IEEE 830; atomic; measurable; INCOSE; traceability; acceptance criteria; functional decomposition; non-functional constraints; stakeholder validation.

You will generate increasingly refined, rule-compliant versions of the above requirement using the hint keywords as guidance.
Repeat the following 2 steps 5 times.
Step 1. Identify 1-3 missing Quality Rules ("; " delimited) from requirements engineering best practices which are violated in the previously generated requirements but could improve quality.
Step 2. Write new, higher-quality requirements of identical length which address every issue from the previous version plus the Missing Quality Rules.
A Missing Quality Rule is:
- Relevant: to requirements quality improvement.
- Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer).
- Novel: not addressed in the previous requirements version.
- Faithful: based on established requirements engineering practices.
- Applicable: can be applied to the given requirements text.
Guidelines:
- The first requirements version should be long (4-5 sentences, ~80 words) yet highly problematic, containing many quality issues like vague terms, combinators, and ambiguous language while preserving the original intent.
- Make every word count: rewrite the previous requirements to improve clarity and compliance while making space for additional rule applications.
- Make space with precision, splitting, and removal of vague phrases like "as appropriate" or "user-friendly".
- The requirements should become highly precise and testable yet complete, e.g., fully specifying the intended behavior.
- Missing quality rules can be applied anywhere in the new requirements.
- Never drop functional intent from the previous requirements. If space cannot be made, apply fewer new rules.

Remember, use the exact same number of words for each requirements version.

Answer in JSON. The JSON should be of the form:

```json
{
  "refined_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Single, atomic requirement text",
    },
    {
      "requirement": "Another atomic requirement if splitting occurred",
    }
  ],
  "changes_made": [
    "Specific changes applied (e.g., 'Split into 3 atomic requirements', 'Removed escape clauses', 'Added measurable criteria', 'Eliminated combinators', 'Used positive phrasing')"
  ],
